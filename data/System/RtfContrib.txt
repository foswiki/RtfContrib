---++ Usage
The current use is restricted to exporting wiki content from a topic and insert it
into a RTF template file. This template file contains tags like
=%<nop>FORMFIELD{"FirstName"}%= and =%<nop>TEXT%= which are replaced with the data extracted from 
the current topic. When you call the =rtf= CGI script on a topic like this
<verbatim>
http://your.domain.com/cgi-bin/foswiki/rtf/Main/TestUser?template=Main.UserForm.user-form.rtf&filename=Hello.rtf
</verbatim>
the script will use the RTF template =user-form.rtf= attached to the topic =Main.UserForm=
and process it as outlined. The result is then cached in a configurable =CacheDir= under the
name =Hello.rtf= in addition to sending it to the browser. Your browser can be configured to open up
the received file with an appropriate word processing tool.

---++ Template tags
The following tags are replaced with data drawn from a topic 
| *Name* | *Description* |
| =%<nop>TEXT%= | topic text |
| =%<nop>SECTION{"name"}%= | named topic section |
| =%<nop>FORMFIELD{"name"}%= | formfield of an attched <nop>DataForm |
| =%<nop>ATTACHMENT{"name" format="..."}%= | information about attached files |
| =%<nop>IMAGE{"url"}%= | inserts an image downloaded from the given url; \
  supported image formats are jpeg, png, ... |

---++ Customizing RTF output
The basic layout of the RTF output is specified by an RTF file that serves as a template.
So you have the freedom to create such a document as you like. This extension comes with
a few predefined templates that might help you to adjust them to you own needs.

In addition there are some preference variables that determine the formatting of output
generate while translating Foswiki markup to RTF.

   * headings: ...
   * lists: ...
   * ...
